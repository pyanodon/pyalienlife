## Bug Reports and Feedback

Please use a dedicated repository [pybugreports](https://github.com/pyanodon/pybugreports) for bug reports and feedback.

## Contributing

When making a Pull Request, please also update `changelog.txt` with the summary of your changes.  
If there is no upcoming version in the file, then the format is as follows:
```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: a.b.c
Date: ???
  Changes:
    - The summary of your changes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Here is a quick guide on how to initiate a code review/pull request if you have never done so on Github.
  - Fork the repository (button in the top right on Github), it makes a private copy of it.
  - Clone your fork onto your PC.
  - Create a new branch based on the main branch.
  - Make your changes, make your commit(s), test whether they do what you want.
  - Push the commit(s) to your private fork repository.
  - Use Github to initiate a pull request in your private fork repository (button on the top, says "Compare & pull request"). If you have multiple commits it will create one pull request for all of them together.
