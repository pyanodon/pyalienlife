-- *: means this is not required for a recipe to work
-- *@*: is only used in single recipe mode as is (i.e. singlerecipe = true) dualmode adds a number
-- *#*: is only used in dual recipe mode (i.e. singlerecipe = false)
-- **: its all or nothing with these 3. if you use probability you have to use min and max
-- ***: amount min and max are optional as by default it is set to 1:1 which will give you perecent chance
-- *&*: return item allows you to set an item to be a result in the input recipe. amount is not need as it defaults to useing the same value as the item its a part of
--[[
*!*: inggredients and results carry over from the top recipe down. amount can have a few possible entries.
+,-,*,/,R, and numbers.
 +,-,*,/: if an item with the same name exist in the mats above this recipe it will preform the set math operation on that amount useing the new value (i.e. old amount + new amount). if this is a new item being added it will perform the math operation on the default value of the item from the items table.
R: will clear this entry from the ingredients/results table it is in
numbers: sets amount to this value no matter what it was before

--if you use the icon part its set to want a size 64 icon right now. if you want to use the size 32 ones ill need to add icon size in because i cant detect the icons size in the code
