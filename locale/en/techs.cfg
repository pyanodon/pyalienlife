osteocyte=You have perfected osteocyte cloning, using plasmid vectors to directly insert the new DNA to improve bone mass in a living animal. The extra weight will damage its joints, but improve bone production by 100%.
hardened-bone=Pronuclear injection of an alien sea creature genome to make their bone matrix extra thick and dense. Bone production at 200%. High consumption of minerals and movement limitation is detected.
organ-replication=Intentional growth increase of internal organs beyond their natural sizes, facilitated by liposome methods, by inserting genes that code for tumoral growth.
cavity=Allows for almost-controlled cell growth in the organ cavities, making them thicker, heavier and more effective, but also causes an increase in energy consumption. It will shorten the creature's lifespan due to a high chance of organ failure, but improve their production of guts by 200%.
somatic=Use protoplasm fusion to cut red marrow's DNA at common protein points, and add other alien genes that will spread to the entire bone. This will cause blood production to surpass blood degradation. Will shorten the creature's lifespan, but blood production will increase by 100%.
transgenes=Inserting trits' genes into the creature, allowing blood cells to undergo mitosis, doubling down the blood density and production. Causes clogs in the bloodstream and will shorten the creature's lifespan even further.
defective-collagen=RNA splicing, targeting a specific chitin protein production gene (CPP-7) into a collagen production DNA string. Encodes a defective collagen variant, forcing the creature to produce even more of it to provide the same effect as before.
double-skin=Experimental insertion of stochastic genes from a yotoi fruit's peel led to an extra layer of adaptive skin incorporated in the creature's derma. This will make your creatures more resistant, dangerous and give them a distinct green hue.
force-feeding=Contained creature with a tube inserted to force-feed them, causing weight gain by fat production. Lucky for you there is no ethics board out here.
fto4=A mutated INSIG2 polymorphic gene provokes upregulation in the hypothalamus, simulating food deprivation and strongly correlating the expression of the orexigenic chain. It will cause a constant feeding stimulus, causing obesity in the creature.

argumented-spikes=The techniques developed up until now allow the insertion of xenos' genes used for adaptive skin protrusion mutations. Initially, minor ones that involve cross-metabolic adjustments by permitting more minerals to be aggregated in the cellular matrix.
conarium-stem=Intentional genetic drift in this GMO species causes scrondrixes to develop better and more functional pineal glands (and a third eye as a consequence). Some are even considered to have metaphysical qualities.
hydrolase-amplification=Chemical enhancers added to food make this class of enzymes work more, causing hardening and thickening of the tendons of the creature. Causes mobility issues, but they won't go too far from their enclosures anyway.
zootoxins=What could possibly go wrong in adding improved chemically-degrading biological materials into an already potent venom in that giant worm-like creature? Added cytotoxins, cardiotoxins and phospholipase A2.
artificial-calcification=Use your learned supramolecular chemistry to include potent calcinating reagents in the circulating water of xyhiphoe enclosures. These will attach to their existing shells and grow to twice their size from mineral aggregation.
stochastic-cortex=Uses a target-and-miss gene, adding to the already complex mess of the cridren genotype. Aiming to improve the cridren cortex through a complex biochemical regimen.
bladder=Improve phagnots' gas bladder capacity by using simple mukmoux DNA transcription.

diversified-mycoaccretion=Fungus transcriptase bound with the native GMO DNA promotes impressive pheromone trails inside the hive. Multiple hives join to become a unified super organism.

parthenogenesis=Direct vrauks to go toward parthenogenesis, no males needed. That will make breeding faster, energy heavy and boring. The extra shells also increase pollution.
natural-cycle=Turning off lights during night to bring those vrauks more comfort. It will also save energy in these buildings and allow those vrauks to be more productive in the morning. Respecting vrauks sleeping patterns will reduce speed.
cyanic-recycling=Vrauk biology naturally produces formic acid in the bloodstream. Use this useful chemical to break down the molecular structure of cyanic waste compounds into its constituents.
reuse-water=Freshen up and reuse any wastewater produced by these native creatures. They will be drinking the same barrel of water for the rest of their life.
mercy-killing=Play music, let them rest a bit. Relaxed animals before slaughter renders with more and with better quality parts. Slaughtering will grant extra skin, carapaces, pelts, chitin, shells, fish oil, and photophores.
laser-cutting=Abandon the old saws and automated knives. Install lasers for precise and cleaner cuts causing instant death of the animal. Slaughtering will grant extra blood, lard, sulfuric acid, bones, and brains.
lard-machine=Use animal fat and greases to lubricate the building's moving parts, saving costs and giving new uses to the unwanted animal parts. Slaughtering will grant extra meat, arthropod blood, guts, formic acid, bonemeal, tendons, and keratin.
sawdust=Auogs aren't picky eaters. You can feed them up to 50% sawdust and they don't even notice. Mostly.
glowing-mushrooms=Feed your worker animals with mind-altering hallucinogenic mushrooms instead of food. These drugs will prevent their normal sleeping and eating patterns, but will increase their productivity. They will work until they drop dead from exhaustion. The auog-powered generator will be significantly faster and more productive.
underground-chambers=Do extra digging to provide auogs a better environment. The extra comfort will improve the production, but will make the enclosure consume extra power for the ceiling fans and heating on cold nights.
scraping-bots=Add specialized bots to scrap manure and used bedding from ground, making the enclosure cleaner and ulrics happier.
heated-pads=Saddle up those GMO horses. The underside of the pad has ceramic particles that reflect body heat back as soothing infrared rays, also provides ventilation for added comfort. Will improve speed and productivity.
dummy-ulric=Ulrics naturally generate several epoxic compounds in their hooves, bones, and eye sockets. The impact crusher can grind these animal appendages down into more useful forms such as epoxy resins, also known as glue.
air-conditioner=Earth's bee and wasp species suffer from colony collapse disorder, which will cause a huge reduction in insect population during winter conditions. The arqad GMO species experiences a similar colony collapse when exposed to extreme temperatures. Through experimentation you have also discovered a dramatic increase in hydrocarbon concentrations due to an activation of hibernation instincts. Distribution of near-liquid nitrogen gases into the apiary will provide the adequate conditions for colony collapse.
cags=Install CAGS (Climate-adaptive glass shell) into arqad apiaries. Arqad chromogens dynamically interact with the variability in their environment light which will help them maintain optimal heating and lighting conditions.
drone=Further research into arqad biology allows for an alternative queen production method. The creature chamber will now provide a direct assembly recipe. Due to the increased genetic complexity, the creature assembly process will take several minutes to build this advanced organism from scratch.
improved-pathfinding=Install better sensors and algorithms. The improved machinery will improve the harvester pathfinding, increasing production speed and energy consumption.
precise-cutting=Native seaweed crops have a useful relationship with the common lime. Use calcium hydroxide as a growth medium for the seaweed crop. During the growth cycle the lime fluids are either fully absorbed or evaporated. After the addition of carbon particulates, collect a calcium carbide remainder.
recirculation-pump=Install recirculation pumps into the seaweed crop facility. This upgrade will allow all water to be recycled for future harvests.
inoculator=Discover an efficient process for creating ash from sap using the FTS reactor. Tall oil is bubbled through a thick slurry bed, where it boils the catalyst and forms steam. The hot gases will rise to the top of the reactor and can be collected in storage tanks. The solid fraction that remains in the slurry bed is the ash product. The ash consists primarily of spent catalyst and mineral residues from the sap. The ash will settle at the bottom of the reactor and can be removed periodically using an internal centrifuge.
patch=Create a parasitic relationship between sap trees and the bhoddos fungus. The bhoddos siphons resources from the internals of the sap tree. In response, the sap tree produces the valuable resveratrol enzymes. Implement special machinery to harvest this delicate phenol structure from the fungal mass without harming the tree.
bark=Pulverize adult sap trees using the wood processing unit. The sap is released from the wood tissues during the pulverization process and separated by a filtration system. Recycle any excess biomaterial into the next generation.
abacus=Donate abacus to arthurians to keep them training their coding skills. This will provide leisure and reduce stress for the cubs. It will improve productivity, but you may need to craft several abacuses.
heated-stone=Install heated stones to keep them warm on cold nights instead of standard bedding. That will accelerate their metabolism, help hatching eggs, and provide extra comfort.
cannibalism=Allow weak and old arthurians be consumed by the young generation to help with maturation. You might even get a cherry.
sc-core=Natural vonixes seem fully immune to cancerous tumors. Perform deep analysis on vonix's venom sacs. Countless microfibrils exist within this organic system, which have been shown to create targeted cell destruction onto tumorous biomass. The atomizer can transform these nanomachines into pharmaceutically-viable dynemicin.
sub-atomic=The xenos cognition osteochain has been shown to complement and even outcompete the xeno hive mind in certain measurements. You have theorized that, if atomized, this bonemorphogenetic organ could function as a pseudo-organic substrate for the powerful kondo processor.
d-core=Use knowledge from the Schrödinger antelope research projects. Allows the atomizer to nullify and reduce the dimensional gastricorg into third dimensionally ordered inverted opals, a precursor to pure photonic crystals.
pentadimensional=Uses powerful raw energy to enclose the antelopes onto the 5th dimension or lower. They can still travel between planes, but will escape less.
existential-hazard=Forces antelopes to stay in this dimension more time than their dimensional gastricorg allows. It will increase the strangelets leakage around the area. This constraint will also decrease their breeding speed since the antelopes can only do that inside the "outside" dimensions.
higgs-field=L = -1/2 tr [Fμν F^(μν)] + ΨLiγ^μDμΨL + tr[(DμΦ)† DμΦ]+ μ2 Φ†Φ -1/2 λ(Φ†Φ)^2 + ( 1/2 ΨTL ChΦΨL + h.c. )
extra-drones=Remove the key ingredients used by the bhoddos to regulate nuclear fission chain reactions. This action dramatically speeds up the production rate for the bhoddos fungus however the risk of nuclear explosion is now 100%. [font=default-semibold][color=255,60,60]☢ WARNING ☢: Picking this option will destabilize the nuclear fisson reactions and cause active bhoddos cultures to violently explode.[/color][/font] Explosions do not damage the bhoddos culture itself however they will destroy any other entities in the radius (including other bhoddos cultures). Expect 1 explosion per 2 hours per active colony. The explosion creates ghosts and can be automatically repaired.
exoenzymes=Instruct the bhoddos fungus to consume additional nuclear energy and introduce the ability for the fungus to secrete exoenzymes. These efficient cellular automata are designed to capture weakened isotopes from the nuclear fuel rods and bind them inside solid soil, replacing carbon dioxide as a waste product.
gills=Develop surface gills and a better inter-cellular matrix allowing bhoddos to rotate themselves so they are always exactly parallel with gravity. This means that even if bhoddos moves or bends the gills will still be able to release spores successfully. Spore collectors are able to collect these released spores from the environment.
high-viability=Seeding high-viability (>85%) three-dimensional alginate-chondrocyte hydrogel scaffolds with photocrosslinking of methacrylate-modified alginate with the photoinitiator VA-086. Requires UV activation, so bioscaffolds will require lamps.
biomimetics=Greatly slows down the printing process. Allows the creation of fabricated structures that are exactly identical to the natural structure.
covalent=Allows the automated bioprinter to reuse discarded organs and body parts as crosslinking for new parts.
molecular-polyentomology=Naphtha is a flammable liquid hydrocarbon mixture with a relationship to the arqad genetics. Use their biological processes to build from scratch this useful hydrocarbon chain.
compusun=Expose phytoplankton to solar energy inside the open reactors. These microbes will consume and absorb any carbon source into a semi-solid pre-oil combination of kerogen and carbon black. You have discovered that dried, reconstituted meat scapings work best for this process.
resonant=Certain native arthropods such as the xyhiphoe have a fine structure underneath their carapace, distinct from a skeleton. Research shows this structure is used as scaffolding and to hold nervous tissue. Use burning air, boiling fluids, and ethyl-based disinfectants to kill any biological activity on the surface. Only the hard internal structure will remain. The structure is less efficient as a filter due to the rough treatment.
aerators=Xeno eggs contain a lot of fun enzymes and catalysts to gestate the embryo. These can be used in bio reactors to greatly improve the speed and number of module slots of these reactors. [font=default-semibold][color=255,60,60]WARNING: Picking this option will cause all bio reactors to require a small amount of xeno eggs as a burnt fuel.[/color][/font] These enzymes also work on the xenos themselves, thus providing an easy way to get hydrogen peroxide and anthraquinone from them.
baffles=You can use the magnetic fields generated by high flux cores to optimise the reactions in a bio reactor, greatly improving their speed and number of module slots. You're basically using the magnetic fields to stir the inputs without actually disturbing the input with a stirrer. [font=default-semibold][color=255,60,60]WARNING: Picking this option will cause all bio reactors to require a small amount of high flux cores as a burnt fuel.[/color][/font] As a side effect of all your tinkering with magnetic fields, you found a way to make nanomachines with entirely different and much cheaper materials.
jacket=Surprisingly, the DNA samples you downloaded from Strorix787 are actually useable as catalysts for the processes in a bio reactor, greatly improving their speed and number of module slots. [font=default-semibold][color=255,60,60]WARNING: Picking this option will cause all bio reactors to require a small amount of exotic DNA samples as a burnt fuel.[/color][/font] Furthermore, it appears they can do the job of mutant enzymes in the process that makes chitosan if you add some blood to it as well.
acid-comtemplator=A standard greenhouse will use basic elements to neutralize the soil acidity which is naturally produced by this crop facility. Removing the dependence on acidic elements will increase crop density, however the soil will need to be replaced constantly.
solar-scope=Replace the greenhouse plastic with a special material made from a nano-lens. The medium will focus and increase the solar energy density over these crops, improving their growth rate and removing the energy requirement for artificial heating.
e-photo=Uses special light spectrums to break down and neutralize any excess acidity generated at the plant's roots. Grants a small byproduct of MSA acid in the soil that can be collected. The required light spectrums must be generated via artificial luminescence, increasing total energy usage.
constant=Composting is always an exothermic process. The heat is generated by microbial activity and retained by insulation. At industrial scales, this residual heat can reach up to 250 degrees Celsius. Pouring water on the resulting biomass will instantly vaporize it, creating a significant amount of steam. Counterintuitively, the vaporization process creates additional escape channels for existing moistures in the compost. This reduction in the overall moisture content will result in dry biomass.
humus=Certain strains of aerobic manure bacteria flourish when mixed with the molasses contained in sweet tuuphra nectar. By adding this syrup to your compost bins, the resulting biomass becomes the perfect breeding ground for retrovirus. [font=default-semibold][color=255,60,60]WARNING: Picking this option will cause all composters to require a small amount of sweet syrup as a fluid fuel (0.1 per second per MK level).[/color][/font] Consumption rate is also scaled based on module effects. Due to the extra biological activity, composters also gain 5% productivity per MK level.
worm-hotel=Your composter attracts thousands of burrowing worms. The biofactory is able to separate these earth dwellers from the biomass, leaving powdered compost behind. These worms are able to crush various materials more efficiently than can be done through abiotic technologies.
respiratory=Use the data array to open-source your scientific advancements with other researchers in the home galaxy. The alien data is revised by the community and returned with high fidelity. Due to the extra operational equipment, energy costs increase dramatically.
neural-fusion=Redesign the creature chamber for the arthurian brain cellular matrix to be usable as a standard procedure in neural and brain maturing and organization, speeding up the longest of embryo phases.
cc=The cellular blueprints for worker creatures such as caravans and digosaurs are not native to this galaxy. This forces the designs of these creatures to be generalized for function in all environments. Use additional DNA samples when constructing these creatures in order to make them more efficient. Speed and health are increased by 35%. The more complex biological construction process will take significantly longer.
hsn=Use computational models to track and delete any aberration in the ADAM42 DNA building process by a focused laser array.
enn=Nickel carbonyl is a nickel-based carbonyl with caustic and volatile properties, especially when exposed to biological material. A discovery was made that this biohazard could help in the synthesis of polyketide synthase enzymes (PKSs) by neutralization of nucleotides in the sample. The addition of this chemical will allow the chambers to have less than 0.0001% chance of xeno DNA mutation errors. The cycle in each stage will take longer, but the specimens will be the closest to perfection.
dwx=Polyvinylpyrrolidone is a hygroscopic, amorphous, synthetic polymer consisting of linear 1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidinone groups. This chemical will improve the effectiveness of heavy-metal ATPases by absorbing any remaining moisture and forcing the plants to become hydrophobic.
sixth-layer=Add instructions to allow cridrens develop up to the sixth layer in their adrenal cortexes. This is an unknown territory and the complexity of the substances produced are still under research. Cridrens will be able to fully consume certain species and process their constituent chemicals. A few studies demonstrated they may be able to communicate and influence other native animals behavior.
neural-cranio=Provides a fluid connection between the cortexes improving cridren reaction time and reflexes. The quick communications will allow the body to receive real time stimulus improving their hunting instincts and voracity.
mufflers=Install blinders and mufflers into the cridren enclosures to not scare or frighten the preys before they get killed. The plants will provide a mercy assassination and the cridren will not eat a stressed animal. This technique will improve regurgitation speeds and reduce energy loss.
booster=Uses one of the X-Band satellites to boost the connection with the Earth Inter-Orbital database. The communication between data-array and satellite will be in a more concentrated wave however energy requirements will increase geometrically.
dbwt=Install an improved transcoder into your data arrays. This chip will allow for the automatic digital storage and duplication of generic earth samples given a template object.
solar-p=Cover some areas of the dishes with solar panels to improve energy savings and increase download speeds. You will also learn a cost-effective way to produce simple solar cells.
cover=Install glass covers to dhilmo pools blocking them from suicide behavior by jumping out the enclosure. It's good to save some dhilmos, but the UV light won't pass by the glass and will affect the phytoplankton they love.
skimmer=Install protein skimmers reducing the waste generated by dhilmos which improves their quality of life and affects their growth. This new machinery will remove the need to provide filtration media. The enclosure will automatically flush the skimmers in their scheduled water changes.
double-intake=Install double intake pumps. They are using the same shaft but with another pin wheel on the other end. You just greatly increased the water flow and cut the energy costs. The new intake pump is able to directly salinate the water.
alpha=The alpha dingrit is the oldest, wisest, and strongest leader of the pack. In order to become an alpha, those dingrits must survive countless fights over many years. Survival is not guaranteed.
c-mutation=Let's remove a few layers of radiation protection. We can even feed the dingrits fewer pharmaceuticals before the journey. Your space dingrits will experience rapid cell mutation and degradation while outside the protection of a magnetic field. There is a chance that the sample will become fully unrecoverable, however these extreme mutations will grant an overall greater probability to obtain the rare and useful snarer hearts.
training=Train your dingrits by parallel behavior to put the waste in the proper area after they eat.
multi-tit=Uses all 8 tits of korlexes instead of the traditional 4. That will prevent the calves from natural nursing, but will increase the milking production.
high-pressure=Uses high pressure hydrogen to speed up and improve the milk pasteurization rate, producing long-term and high quality korlex milk. The pasteurization process can filter out tiny crystalline solids from the mixture.
nx-heat-pump=Upgrade the coolers and heating systems with nexelit cartridges to improve the efficiency of the coolers in that enclosure, saving energy. The animals will be more comfortable and will work faster.
lichen=Instead of using guts, allow the navens to bind itself directly with any large mammalian host. The fungus will have full control over both neural and motor function. Slaughtering the hybrid creature will allow for a large harvest of adult navens fungus.
acidosis=Insert xeno genes into fawogae allowing them to have an advantage in competition for food with other creatures by acidification of the area, blocking harmful bacteria and other fungi from growing in fawogae plantations.
dry=Cultivate the fawogae under extreme pressure. This technique will cause a larger buildup of carbon molecules inside the mushroom's roots. More energy will be required to maintain this environment.
a-select=Fishes that didn't pass in the automated test will be automatically thrown into biomass recycling and be reused as supplement food to the ones which passed.
temp-control=The whole fish undergoes mincing, enzymatic digestion, grinding and liquefaction to produce liquid fish hydrolysate. The resulting substance is also known as gurry. The process is known to be more efficient at cooler temperatures due to the preservation of the complex protein, carbohydrate and fat structures in the fish material. Adding active cooling components will increase the yield of the hydrolysation process however there is a risk of mechanical wear.
dosing-pump=Install automatic dosing pumps to reduce waste and improve fish life quality. Flushed byproducts will be collected and stored for future use. [font=default-semibold][color=255,60,60]WARNING: Picking this option will edit the pipe locations of all fish farms.[/color][/font] The high-speed pumping apparatus requires additional electricity to operate.
dry-storage=Allow logs to rest several days in the sun to remove excess moisture and improve fiber quality by weight.
sawblades=Develop technologies for the production of specialized sawblade wheels. These sawblades take the place of regular modules inside the wood processing unit with improved speed and productivity percentages. The productivity effects all wood processing unit recipes, even those that normally are not benefited by productivity. The TURD-upgraded wood processing units have 3 module slots per tier. [font=default-semibold][color=255,60,60]WARNING: Wood processing units will require at least one sawblade module to function.[/color][/font] Picking this option will also prevent beacons from influencing wood processing units.
selective-heads=Remove branches and excess bark during the cutting, as preparation for further processing. The second stage of wood processing becomes much faster.
self-generation=Use sticks, wood chips, and leaves to fuel an internal burner. The burner will generate part of the electricity consumed by the building. Those hungry trees will need more ash to grow
carbonefarious=Anthracene oil, a byproduct of coal tar, has been studied for its effects on tree growth and health. Add this substance into the sapling lifecycle for a threefold benefit.\n1. Controlled application of anthracene oil helps tree species manage moss parasite growth due to certain biocidal properties.\n2. Lifetime application of the oil acts as a pre-treatment step allowing uses in electronics-grade PCB manufacturing.\n3. Increased familiarity with anthracene oil processing inspires a new production method involving extracting polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from high grade distillates.
hi-sprinkler=Install more advanced sprinklers allowing tons of pressurized water to fall over the needy grods. The extra water will allow for a greater harvest.
ground-irrigation=Feed extra tailings to your grod phytomining operation. More heavy metals will be concentrated into the plant's roots for collection.
carbide-c=Exchange all the water collection systems with reinforced and modern carbide upgrades. Some water can be recycled and the pumps will run less, saving electricity. Stored water will accumulate inside the grod pistils and could be extracted as nutrient-rich flavonoids.
gs=Add fish cerebrospinal fluid in the incubation media for an additional catalyst and carbon source. The manure bacterial growth process will become more productive.
zero=You have discovered a rare strain of zogna bacteria that cannot react to luminescence. This zogna subgroup must be grown in complete darkness inside the incubation chamber.
icd=Install recirculation systems which will re-pump pressurized air and fluids back to the incubation chambers. The ICD systems will improve generic sample collection from the native flora.
wire-netting=Install heating systems to help dry and bake those kicalks during the growth process. Those well-baked trees are perfect to extract biomass and extra fibers, however they are useless for feeding animals. 
extra-water=Provide salted water for these water hungry trees, making them produce more leaves and grow faster. The irrigation process will help dislodge kicalk seeds which can be collected.
crop-rotation=Allows other species to grow in the soil during part of the year to replenish lost minerals.
biosynthetic-nylon=Biosynthetic nylon from wood is a process that involves converting biomass into chemical building blocks for producing nylon. Wood is primarily composed of lignocellulose, which consists of three main components: cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The sugars released from the wood biomass are fermented by microbes to produce adipic acid and 1,5-pentanediamine, the key monomers required to synthesize nylon.
eye-out=Remove one or both eyestalks from female kmauts. The aim of ablation under these circumstances is to stimulate the female kmaut to develop mature ovaries and spawn.
sex-ratio=Changes the ratio from 1:1 to 1:3 male-to-female kmauts. More mothers will be available for pup production, but fewer will reach adulthood. Due to the offset male/female ratio, the rare males will greatly overproduce their sticky gels. The enclosure is automatically able to collect these gels for future use.
moult-recycle=Add kmauts moults into their own food to improve their food quality, reducing waste.
hd-moss=The moss growth medium consists of stones with mineral-rich coarse fraction. Typically, after the moss life cycle these geologic structures are depleted of key nutrients. Research into a thorough cleaning and restoration process in order to recycle this growth medium.
remove-muddy-sludge=The moss is kept at the protonema stage by continuous mechanical disruption by using rotating blades. This exposure to the alien atmosphere's biodiversity will remove the requirement of muddy water. Additional energy will be required to maintain the biological processes.
spores=Unopened capsules with both operculum and calyptra intact are collected to provide spores for the next crop. In such conditions sterilization is necessary with distilled water and chlorine.
inbuilt-moss=Add a bioreactor module in the farm that nullifies any pollution made by the cultivation process. The stored pollution can be used to add trace chemicals into certain refined gases, transferring them into an unrefined state.
zero-cross=Blocks any natural breeding happening inside the corrals. All the breeding will now be by artificial insemination. That will drive genetic gains in a sustained manner. The mother will not survive.
bip=Establish a holistic AI system to drive and sustain genetic gains with appropriate infrastructure in place to deliver veterinary services and nutrition. In an effort to reduce waste, any uneaten food will be recycled for future generations.
think-collar=Install into each mukmoux a brain implant with advanced sensors that will communicate with advanced AI for cattle behavior, location, water intake and feeding. Supplies environmental data such wind and humidity in order to provide max comfort. Some fetal blood may be spilled from the baby mukmouxes brain implant.
cytotoxicity=Insert part of the vonix genoma into navens code to improve its toxicity and dissolving agents, making the substrate being digested and absorbed faster. Cytotoxin concentrations in the fungus will increase and can be collected for use in pesticides inside the biofactory.
pre-sterilization=Reduce the number of potentially harmful microbes through sterilization of the spores before being put into the navens colony. This will improve productivity since the fungus won't need to compete.
n2-ferti=Reuse the nitrogen-based metabolites such as ammonium nitrate to promote the formation of fawogae primordia, increase yields and reducing waste.
piezoelectric-floor=Equip the dancing floors with a piezoelectric mat. The mechanical energy of the raving phadais can be collected and will charge certain crystals.
ethanol-boost=Add pure ethanol into energy drinks and make those phadais go full frenzy on the dancing floor.
dubstep-track=Adding dubstep to the trance and rave tracks will improve their shaking. May cause joint damage.
hr=Intentionally contaminate phagnot stomachs with a bacteria able to break down the fibers of kicalks. This will remove fiber feeding requirements during all life stages.
socialization=Keeping phagnots in appropriate family groups encourages natural behaviors between individuals and rewarding relationships and interactions. Will speed up reproduction.
leader=Phagnot herds rarely ever have a leader. Inducing them to go against that behavior will provide another level of organization. To honor their new sovereign, the herd will provide even rarer gases in their gas bladders.
igm=80% of effort is only worth 20% of the result. Run those unethical experiments on your cottonguts for 5x longer before slaughtering them. In return, their research data will be slightly more valuable.
ts=Provide your cottonguts with the highest quality meals. Boiled rat meat mixed with extracts from the moon shroom. Garnished with powdered seaweed and shredded acorn.
ud=Cottonguts are very sensitive to ultrasound. It affects them negatively. To avoid low reproduction rates install ultrasound dampers made from heavy metals in the walls of the prandium labs.
moon=Moondrops got their name because their flowers only open under light reflected from one of the planet's moons. Install special, high-powered lamps into the greenhouse and improve production by constantly simulating moonlight.
cu=Moondrops have several copper-containing enzymes that play an important role in photosynthesis, respiration and the formation of lignin. This process requires soil rich in copper and is what gives them their distinct blueish colors. Certain soils naturally contain trace amounts of copper however the addition of raw copper ore into their fertilization routine will improve the crop yield.
carbon-capture=Install small filters that will absorb escaping CO2 from the greenhouse, helping moondrops in their carbon capture. Allows self-sufficient production of CO2 without external inputs.
simik-copper=Stage one of the simik digestive mutation program. Allows the simik digestive process to directly process geothermal fluids into copper.

sun-concentration=Cover the ralesia's dome with a ceramic layer that will help focus the sunlight at the right level from the soil.
h2-recycle=Ralesias contain trace amounts of helium in their cell structure. Use hydrogen diffusion to replace helium molecules and collect it for future use.
deadheading=Rennea blossoms sometimes die off quickly and become "deadheads". Re-program the plantation machinery to automatically detect and remove these defects. Using a special growth procedure, these deadheads can be recycled into useful native flora.
alltime=Increase irrigation to extreme levels. This will force rennea flowers to become perennial. This technique will increase average growth speed, however extra electricity is required to pump all that water. The various soils are no longer required and are washed away.
aphid-cleaning=A lack of genetic diversity causes renneas to be very susceptible to small pests such as aphids. You have discovered that small amounts of arqad venom can act as a great proto-pesticide.
unstable=The addition of a common dermal layer will allow for significant data collection of the alien environment.
ms=The addition of semi-rare galenic materials will provide improvements in the plasma control system and increase the speed of ionic measures in the mass-to-charge ratio of the object of study.
spg=The addition of a passivation layer will calm existing microorganisms in the substrate. Microscopes will render images in higher orders of magnitude of resolution.
mci=The addition of high-grade mova syrup will act as a preservative for the rare and expensive perfect samples. The likelihood of cross-contamination is dramatically reduced by this technique.
neuron=Splicing an arthurian neural gen into scrondrix genoma will allow their brain cells to intercommunicate at near light speed, increasing their intelligence at a geometric scale. This procedure is very dangerous but it will result in significantly more neural material when slaughtered. If this material is eaten, it grants a temporary alien <-> human speech capability.
boronb=Scrondrix brain chemistry is completely different to anything found on earth. Apparently, boron derivatives can act as a performance enhancing and hallucinogenic substance to scrondrix biology. By adding diborane into the water supply they will gain a great reproductive boost. Mutations are also more common.
hspa=Crosslink alkali dissociation in their intestines will allow scrondrixes to function on a pure carnivore diet after maturation. A simplified diet will generally lead to a reduction in overall energy and activity, however the number of scrondrix factory inputs is greatly decreased. Evolution also becomes more difficult.
arcanium=Bombard simik's arcaniums (organs responsible for procreation) with microwaves can induce heat, boosting their production.
etelnav=Install patented Etelnav systems to use waste heat from that enclosure to generate power.
flagellum=Creates a new generation of sponges with triple the amount of flagellum in their choanocytes. These sponges form study skeletons in the growth medium and allow for the conversion of softer elements.
fragmentation=When the sponges reach a certian phase in their life cycle, they will begin a reaction that causes fragmentation of its own branches. If landed into a suitable substrate, their mesophyll will reshape and attach to the new place, making a new sponge.
bacterial=Mutate choanocytes to capture and engulf bacteria in the water, reducing the need of food and sterilizing the water.
mgo=Trits have metagenesis breeding cycles, which mean they have some individuals just to grow and others just to procreate. Inserting a common ancient Earth gene from mammals can turn this creature into a complete typical breeding cycle leading to more offspring.
dc=Trits's cubs will naturally split into two halves which mature separately. Through research, you have found that nanomachines can make adjustments to the genoma. This will allow those cubs to split into even more mature trits.
nexelit-axis=Change the pressure pumps main axis for a new and improved nexelit-based one. Allowing a way better use of energy and enough pressure to keep trits happy.
fi=A total of 5-6 irrigations are added during germination including pre-sowing irrigation, improving consumption and production.
fungicide=Your soil isn't welcome to tuuphras. Spray heavy fungicide to avoid the dreaded "Late Blight" disease. Sometimes phosphates are necessary. These chemicals will improve the crop's growth, but they will also cause massive amounts of pollution.
tr=Recycle the smaller and discarded tuuphra tubes as a source of organic starches and greases.
evoa=Deep research and gene implementation from earth's arthropods will turn vonix less alien and more anthropod-like. This technology allows investment into live birthing for vonixes while exponentially increasing their viable embryo production rate. The mother will not survive.
uge=Insert a defective gene that causes dysregulation in vonix's metabolism, speeding up their growth but making their lives miserable. Cancerous subcultures are harvestable from the vonix's enclosure.
dermal=Splice auog's genes into the vonix genoma. This will help them with their aggression and will cancel any nomadic behavior patterns. Instead of an enclosure, your vonixes will be fully free range, removing enclosure costs.
ap=Allow xenos to incorporate more of the host's DNA allowing them to use any level and species of hosts, any sex and age to develop their final forms.
herm=Xenos will have the ability to sidestep parthenogenesis. When a low genetic variability is detected, allow some of them to change sexes during life in an attempt to recover the genetic pool by sexual reproduction.
hive=Insertion of arthurian's genes allows xenos to have a collective consciousness directed by the queen, who can call back and give orders to her subjects using shrieks and telepathy, more organization means less waste. This modification will allow the queen to communicate telepathically with other advanced species, such as you, inducing terrifying dreams and religious visions which may even lead to the formation of cults with the xenos as the god-like figures.
temp-c=Use smoldering coals and frozen nitrogen to rapidly cycle simulated temperature changes. Xyhiphoe larvae will be stimulated to mature faster, from 14 to 8 sols for metamorphosis to a benthic stage.
rst=Intervenes at the life cycle stage when larvae are "competent" or ready to settle, attach to clutch, and metamorphose to become a "spat". This is the eyed stage at which the larvae can be safely removed from the culture medium to grow alone, preventing losses from competition.
reuse-ev=Import wastewater from other aquacultures to prepare and feed xyhiphoe's favorite phytoplankton. The plankton are able to separate and reconstitute trace amounts of dissolved acetone in the wastewater.
sub-s=Substrates are a matter of competition. To improve efficiency, the growing medium needs to be sterilized or pasteurized with heated gases. This kills off any competing mold or bacteria and gives yaedols the best chance at dominating any competition.
duct=Re-configure the ducting installation to bring heated air into the growing space. The fungus is able to fully purify and chill the nearby atmosphere.
humidity-control=Install hygrometers to self-regulate the better humidity levels for yaedols, making them absorb CO2 from air efficiently. The yaedols will be able to more effectively expel their spores into the environment through runoff, groundwater, and evaporation. These additional spores can be collected by the spore collector.
cryopreservation=Advanced freezing methods help preserve seed genetics during the offseason. The non-depreciative storage allows fruit development and vegetative development to run as natural at any date in the future.
harvest=Automated machinery and robots are used instead of simple inserters, increasing the quality of the leaves and fruits (since they won't harm them during the harvest). These agribots can also detect dying plants before even the orchard knows they are dying.
nutrinet=Develop the nutrient, an AI controlled system that uses electronic sensors. These high resolution sensors can evaluate soil quality based on available nutrients detected in the soil. Instead of fertilizing an entire field equally, now the AI knows which areas need the most fertilizer and which areas need the least. This not only decreases fertilizer costs, it gives a more even, fuller crop yield from the yotoi fruit and leaves.
suicide=Further studies reveal that artificial abdominal disengagement of the chitinous protrusion from the sternite of zipirs is required before males can mate in any early stage of development. The procedure allows them to have 100% success in breeding even when immature, but they can't live longer without this organ system. Considering maturation for a full adult zipir can take decades, its a valid technique if you don't care about ethics.
sr=Insert modified transposons from trits into zipir's genoma to allow females to develop a spermatheca to retain sperm after mating so that 2 or even 3 egg masses can be produced without the further intervention of another male.
hatchery=Build an attachment of zipir reefs dedicated to provide excellent water conditions for the zipir's eggs. By doing that, recycling the wastewater from the main tank will reduce the pollution and energy costs. Due to the greatly increased population and reproductive rates, it becomes necessary to smelt any extra zipirs for their ash byproduct.
geooxidation=Six tandem copies of yeadols monomers were cloned into the pBC1 vector of zungrors carapace, allowing them to absorb important minerals directly from the soil.
genooscillation=Allows rapid gene oscillation during meiosis, improving genetic variability. In all procedures, the variable spinneret kiloglider organ will be multiplied.
oviduct-bombardment=With great power comes great responsibility. Insert highly radioactive isotopes into the zungror's diet. The zungror oviducts will overcompensate and allow higher availability of the spidroins in the cocoons.
xgv=Using common retroviral technology to keep zungror's genome without degradation. Even improving the quality of cocoon proteins.
d2o=This tech was primarily used for the development of new, enhanced species. But soon we discovered it can be used to produce creatures with specific traits that could be exploited by triggering a series of genetic reactions that would cause numals to produce more of a particular body part, its aeroorgan.
nc=Using a neutron emitter that produces a steady stream of high-energy neutrons, which are then targeted at the Numal's reproductive organs. The neutrons stimulate the creature's reproductive system and encourage the production of additional eggs. However, their viability may vary.
neutron-bombardment=The process involves placing the Numal in a controlled environment and subjecting it to a specific wavelength of light emitted by the neodymium-based crystals. The light penetrates the skin of the Numal and activates the ink glands, causing the creature to produce significantly more ink than it would under normal conditions.
guarpulse=A nanobot-based technology that can monitor the health of individual guar plants in real-time, detecting diseases or nutrient deficiencies before they become a problem. These nanobots can also deliver targeted nutrients or pesticides directly to the plants, reducing waste and increasing efficiency. The semi-perfect environment allows for the occasional production of zinc nanocomplex as a byproduct.
aquaguar=A genetically engineered strain of guar that is resistant to drought and can grow in saline soil. This strain of guar would require less water and fertilizer to grow, making it more sustainable to cultivate.
hh=A drone-based system that uses advanced sensors and AI algorithms to identify the most productive areas of a guar plantation. The drones can then autonomously harvest the ripe guar pods, maximizing yield and minimizing costs.
turd-respec=Resets all T.U.R.D. selections.
turd-partial-respec=Allows you to reselect an option for one T.U.R.D.
