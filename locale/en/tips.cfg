[pywiki-descriptions]
farming=The natural flora and fauna can be processed into multiple useful products. The [item=vrauks] bloodstream contains the useful [fluid=formic-acid] and [item=moondrop] can be processed into [fluid=methane].\n\nAll farmable species fall under one of three kingdoms; plant, animal, or fungi. [item=saps], [item=moss], [item=tree-mk01], [item=fish], and [item=seaweed] can be harvested from the local environment however most aliens must be synthesized through expensive GMO processes in the [entity=creature-chamber-mk01] or [entity=botanical-nursery]. This process will require DNA data stored in a codex such as [item=vrauks-codex] as well as genetic template data from the [entity=data-array].\n\nAfter you have obtained the first species, it’s important to breed further generations to avoid the complicated GMO process. Each kingdom has a unique breeding method.\n\nAnimal - Animal cubs/eggs such as [item=cocoon] can be bred in the [entity=rc-mk01]. This machine requires two parents inserted into the machine’s module slots. Once you have the young pups, each animal can be raised to adulthood in their respective enclosure such as [entity=vrauks-paddock-mk01]. This enclosure also requires adult creatures to be inserted in the module slots.\n\nPlant - Plants require seedlings such as [item=moondrop-seeds] to create the next generation. Convert adult crops into seedlings inside the [entity=botanical-nursery]. These seedlings can then be cultivated into adult crops in large farming structures such as [entity=moondrop-greenhouse-mk01]. Each farm building requires the adult crop to be placed in the module slot. Each cycle will yield more seeds than the input.\n\nFungi - Tiny mushroom spores are plentiful in the atmosphere. The [entity=spore-collector-mk01] will automatically process the air for spore particulates such as [item=fawogae-spore] at no input cost. These spores can then be grown into adult fungi in climatized shroom farms such as [entity=fawogae-plantation-mk01]. The fungi require special substrate material such as [item=fungal-substrate]. These buildings also require adult mushrooms inside the module slots.\n\nIn order to further optimize and increase the output of creature farms further genetic modification is possible up to MK04. This genetic upgrade will increase growth speeds by up to 400%. The most complicated animal species require more advanced data storage methods such as [item=zungror-codex-mk04].
caravans=[entity=caravan] is a living, organic logistics creature with 30 inventory slots and a programmable schedule, similar to a locomotive. It utilizes the biter pathfinding AI.\nThe caravan requires food to function. The caravan consumes food for every destination or when transferring items, with different types of food providing a different number of actions. You can see availible foods when hovering over the caravan's food slot.\nYou can program the caravan to visit any entity, but usually [entity=outpost] is the most useful. When the caravan reaches its destination, you can program specific actions based on that destination.\nCaravans cannot be killed by trains or biters. There is also an [entity=flyavan] and [entity=outpost-aerial].\n\nActions available for different destinations include:\n- Wait: The caravan will stay at the destination. *Does not use food\n- Store food: The caravan will fill its fuel slots from the target's inventory. *Does not use food\n- Fill cargo: The caravan will extract items until its inventory is full.\n- Empty cargo: The caravan will empty its inventory.\n- Load items until caravan has: The caravan will transfer items from target to self until it has the specifed amount of items.\n- Load items until target has: The caravan will transfer items from target to self until target has the specifed amount of items.\n- Unload items until caravan has: The caravan will transfer items from self to target until it has the specifed amount of items.\n- Unload items until target has: The caravan will transfer items from self to target until target has the specifed amount of items.\n- Circuit condition: The caravan will wait at the destination until the circuit condition is met. *Does not use food\n- Collect all autotrash: Collects all items from a player's autotrash inventory.\n\nActions that transfer items have a "Wait until fulfilled" checkbox. When checked, the caravan will continue trying to perform the action until it is complete. When unchecked, the caravan will try to transfer as much items as possible and then continue its schedule even if the action wasn't fulfilled.\n\nDifferent kinds of actions are available for different types of destinations:\n- Player: [Wait, Store food, Transfer items, Collect all autotrash]\n- Outpost: [Wait, Store food, Transfer items, Circuit condition]\n- Another Caravan: [Wait, Store food, Transfer items]\n- Vehicle: [Wait, Transfer items]\n- Electric pole: [Wait, Circuit condition]\n- Default: [Wait]\n\nCaravans, similar to trains, can also have interrupts. After a caravan leaves a destination, it will check all of the interrupts it has and if all conditions on one of them are met, all destinations of the interrupt will be added to the schedule as temporary stops.\nInterrupts have the following conditions: Inventory full, Inventory empty, Cargo item count, Target item count, Food count, Circuit condition, At specified station, Not at specified station.\n\nYou can add filters in an [entity=outpost] to ensure there is enough room for all items that may be transferred between this outpost and caravans.
mounts=Mounts are an effective form of personal transport for every stage of progression that can also help in combat. [item=hazard-concrete] and [item=refined-hazard-concrete] will prevent any mounts from crossing and can act as barriers to avoid destroying important infrastructure.\n\n [item=automation-science-pack]\n\nThe [entity=car] is the most basic and primitive mount. It runs on solid fuel such as [item=raw-coal] and has a top speed of 100km/h. The car is equipped with [item=vehicle-machine-gun] for small arms damage. It stores 80 stacks of items.\n\n [item=logistic-science-pack]\n\n[entity=crawdad] is the first biological mount. Crafted in a [entity=creature-chamber-mk01], this mount is capable of running at a top speed of 85km/h. This creature loves fish and eats [item=fish], [item=fish-mk02], [item=fish-mk03], and [item=fish-mk04]. While running it consumes 800kW. Due to its heavy armor, it is able to ram and destroy obstacles without taking any damage. It stores 90 stacks of items.\n[entity=crawdad] has a 10x4 armor equipment grid; however the center 4x4 tiles are permanently occupied by [item=py-mount-generator]. This generator taps into the biological energy created by the mount and instantly fills any equipment batteries by using the food fuel. Note that this generator is 200% efficient at converting food fuel into equipment grid energy. It’s extremely useful for personal robotics. No other generators are allowed inside the crawdad’s equipment grid.\n\n [item=chemical-science-pack]\n\n[item=dingrido] is a tamed and domesticated form of [item=dingrits]. This mount is able to run at over 250km/h! This mount loves meat products such as [item=meat], [item=dingrits-food-01], and [item=dingrits-food-02] and also benefits from the [item=py-mount-generator]. This mount uses its long legs to traverse on top of buildings without damaging them. It stores 120 stacks of items and has a 10x6 equipment grid.\n\n [item=py-science-pack-3]\n\n[item=spidertron] is a mechanized version of the [item=zungror]. This cyborg life form is able to crawl on eight legs over almost any terrain. It travels at 110km/h and has high acceleration. This mount consumes energy stored inside [item=gastrocapacitor] and it uses the WASD driving mode. It is equipped with 4 cycling [item=spidertron-rocket-launcher-1] that can fire rockets at high speed. The [item=spidertron-remote] can be used to control [item=spidertron] from the map view. Using the remote, multiple [item=spidertron] can be programmed to follow each other in a chain. It stores 160 stacks of items and has a 10x8 equipment grid. This mount benefits from the [item=py-mount-generator].\n\n [item=utility-science-pack]\n\n[item=phadaisus] is the ultimate evolved version of [item=phadai]. With maximum [item=exoskeleton-equipment], it flies at hypersonic speeds over 1700km/h and uses the WASD driving mode. This mount loves to eat [item=phadai-food-01] and [item=phadai-food-02] and can be controlled using the [item=spidertron-remote]. This mount has a devastating [item=dragon-breath] dealing 2100 fire damage/s to any entity in a 6 tile radius. This weapon completely decimates forests. The flame breath is fueled by [item=dragon-breath-ammo] which each provides ammo for five hours. It stores 200 stacks of items and has a 10x10 equipment grid. This mount benefits from the [item=py-mount-generator].
digosaurus=[item=digosaurus] is part of an ancient dinosaur species. Over years of evolution, they have adapted to collect and use [item=nexelit-ore] as an energy source. Exploit it.\nDig-o-saurus must be placed in the [entity=dino-dig-site]. The dig site has a range which it can mine the nexelit. It also requires electricity.\n\nDig-o-saurus requires food to work. Each food allows the Dig-o-saurs gather more ores in the same trip.\n[item=dried-meat] → 1 ore\n[item=guts] → 1 ore\n[item=meat] → 2 ores\n[item=workers-food] → 8 ores\n[item=workers-food-02] → 16 ores\n[item=workers-food-03] → 32 ores\n\n[item=thikat] is a larger, genetically enhanced version of the Dig-o-saurus. Thikat has 100% mining productivity.\n[item=work-o-dile] has 200% mining productivity.\n\nFloor tiles such as [item=py-steel] can improve the running speed of the Digosaurus.
mega-farm=The [entity=mega-farm] has the ability to cultivate patches of plants. You can pick a type of plant and a recipe for that plant, for example [recipe=bioreserve-super-1], then you have to feed the required materials. You then have to insert the collector, for example [item=replicator-bioreserve]. After inserting the collector, you have to 'launch' the 'rocket' - overhyped terms thought up by marketing, no doubt - which generates the patch of your chosen plants to the north of your building. This patch can then be harvested using the [entity=harvester].\n\nWhen the patch dries up, you can repeat the process, for a renewable source of plants such as [item=native-flora]. More complex recipes generate richer patches.
pydrive=You’ve created a species of giant, super fast, yet docile worms. They are able to transfer items instantaneously between different [entity=pydrive] buildings, as long as those buildings are tuned to the identification of the same worm.\n\nUse the rings of checkboxes to select a specific worm - every pattern of checked and unchecked boxes will select a different worm. Your items will still be with the worm if no logistic station is tuned to that worm, you can retrieve them by tuning to that worm again.\n\n[entity=pydrive] requires 10MW of continuous electricity.
ocula=You’ve developed a weird, creepy, overpriced eyeball creature. [item=ocula] is a personal logistics device that will deliver items even if you are outside the range of a roboport.\n\nThe ocula has no range limit, and delivers items based on your personal logistic filters. Very helpful if you don’t have a global logistic network.\n\nThe ocula requires an [item=ipod] for storage. Each eyepod has room for 3 oculus. The eyepod must be placed in range of a roboport network, such as from [item=py-roboport-mk01]. The oculus will only pick up items from that network.\n\n[item=ocula] does not support logistic trash slots.
vatbrain=Sometimes science pushes too far. [entity=vat-brain] grants a large productivity bonus to nearby [entity=lab] at a high cost.\n\n[entity=vat-brain] works similarly to the [entity=beacon], however it must be fed constantly with cartridges such as [item=brain-cartridge-01]. A single cartridge will last for 20 seconds.\nThe effect of multiple vatbrains can stack together, granting a greater productivity bonus. Whenever the cartridge expires, you will lose the productivity bonus.\n\nEach cartridge grants a different amount of productivity to nearby labs:\n- [item=brain-cartridge-01] →25%\n- [item=brain-cartridge-02] →50%\n- [item=brain-cartridge-03] →75%\n- [item=brain-cartridge-04] →100%
symbiosis=The [item=ulric-infusion] allows you to combine the best aspects from multiple species. Inject or digest this serum to temporarily gain heightened physical abilities. This procedure will transform your character into a ulric-human hybrid for 10 minutes.\n\nIncreased attributes include:\n- Running speed +40%\n- Reach distance ×3\n- Health and regeneration ×5\n- Inventory slots +40\n- Train immunity\n- Instant mining speed\n- Powerful melee attack\n\nThe ulric transformation lasts for only 10 minutes however the [item=ulric-infusion-equipment] can autoinject fresh serum from your inventory. Place the [item=ulric-infusion-equipment] inside an armor’s equipment grid and provide power to continuously benefit from the transformation.
turd=Welcome to the technological upgrade and research device. This page contains permanent upgrades to specific machines.\nResearch the primary technology from the technology tree and the T.U.R.D. upgrade options will become available from this menu. Available upgrades include permanent module bonuses, new recipes, and recipe upgrades.\n[item=speed-module-3] Speed bonuses scale with the farm building tier.  [item=productivity-module-3] Productivity bonuses apply to all recipes in a machine.
biofluid=You’ve successfully bio-engineered [entity=gobachov], [entity=huzu], and [entity=chorkok]. These three creatures are biological alternatives to the [entity=py-logistic-robot-mk01]. Instead of transporting items, they will instead help in your fluid logistics. They are able to transfer fluids between [entity=provider-tank] and [entity=requester-tank].\n\nA [entity=bioport] is required to store, feed, and muck out your worker creatures. Unlike the standard [entity=py-roboport-mk01] the Biopyanoport has no logistic radius. Instead, make a direct connection using [entity=vessel] and [entity=vessel-to-ground].\n\n[entity=bioport] requires a constant caloric supply in order to keep the creatures healthy and active. Each tier of worker’s food allows for a different amount of deliveries. Food is always consumed at the beginning of the delivery. [item=efficiency-module-3] can be used. Additionally, the [entity=bioport] will only spawn biofluid creatures at a maximum rate of 1 creature every 2.38 seconds. A biofluid creature will typically return to whichever bioport it came from, but there is a 10% chance for it to spread to another bioport in the same network.\n\nThe [entity=requester-tank] has several useful filter settings. First, configure the requested fluid type and amount. Secondly, configure the requester’s priority when compared to other requesters. Note that if two requesters have the same priority, the requester with the highest request size minus the currently contained fluid will be chosen first. Finally there is an optional temperature filter. The minimum amount of fluid required to be present in a provider for it to be eligible for transfer can be configured in the map settings (by default it is 10000 units), the same goes for the amount of minimum missing fluid in requesters. All requester settings are blueprintable and copypastable.\n\n[item=guano] is a useful waste product created in the [entity=bioport]. When consuming food, each creature generates a small amount of waste shown as the productivity bar. Once the waste bar is full, the bar is reset and 3 [item=guano] are generated in the output slot. Remove the waste products using an inserter or your [entity=bioport] will back-up and stop functioning.\n\nEach biofluid creature has different stats depending on its tier:\n[entity=gobachov] - Tier: MK 01, Speed: 19.4 km/h, Max delivery size: 10000, Waste per trip: 0.6\n[entity=huzu] - Tier: MK 02, Speed: 25.9 km/h, Max delivery size: 15000, Waste per trip: 0.8\n[entity=chorkok] - Tier: MK 03, Speed: 64.8 km/h, Max delivery size: 20000, Waste per trip: 1.3
